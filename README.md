# AccurApp
This is a project kickstarter for the specific needs of Accurat.
It was originally forked from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/),
but in version 3.0.0 significant amounts of code were rewritten and simplified.

## Getting started:
Having installed yarn (`brew install yarn`), run this command which will handle the folder scaffolding, the dependencies installation, and the git initialization with a first commit.
```sh
yarn create accurapp project-name
```

Then you just `cd project-name`, run `yarn start` and start creating awesome stuff! ðŸŽ‰

## Setting up bitbucket
1. Create a new repo
1. Choose `I have an existing project` and follow the instructions

## Setting up the automatic deploy
1. Go into `Settings > Pipelines - Settings` and enable Bitbucket Pipelines
1. Go into `Settings > Pipelines - Environment Variables` and add the environment variables `DEPLOY_CUSTOMER`, `DEPLOY_PROJECT`, `SLACK_CHANNEL`

- [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)

## Features:
- ESLint config is the one configured for Accurat, `eslint-config-accurapp`, based on StandardJS with some customizations
- Babel presets are `stage-0` and `latest` with decorators support
- GLSL webpack loader, to import shaders and require shaders within shaders

## Project Scaffolding
```
â”œâ”€â”€ build             # created when you run yarn build
â”œâ”€â”€ public            # put the static stuff here
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ App.js
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ lib           # put here the stuff you will most likely reuse
â”‚Â Â  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.css
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc         # put here your eslint customizations
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ bitbucket-pipelines.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ webpack.config.js
â””â”€â”€ yarn.lock
```

## Customizing Webpack
Edit the `webpack.config.js` and add new [webpack-blocks](https://github.com/andywer/webpack-blocks), to see how to create custom blocks, add plugins, add loaders, check out their [docs](https://github.com/andywer/webpack-blocks).
```js
const buildWebpackConfig = require('webpack-preset-accurapp')
const sass = require('@webpack-blocks/sass')

module.exports = buildWebpackConfig([
  sass(),
])
```

## Customizing Babel
Create a `.babelrc` and pass it to `buildWebpackConfig` in the second arguments, which is an object of overrides
```js
// .babelrc
{
  "presets": ["latest"],
  "plugins": ["fast-async"]
}

// webpack.config.js
const buildWebpackConfig = require('webpack-preset-accurapp')

module.exports = buildWebpackConfig([], {
  babel: { babelrc: true },
})
```

## Customizing Eslint
Add your custom rules to the `.eslintrc`

## Contributing
If you make some edits and wish to test them locally you can run `yarn create-test-app` which creates a test app using the local packages.

## TODOs
- use CommonsChunkPlugin for faster build times?
- do more beautiful console output like zeppelin does
